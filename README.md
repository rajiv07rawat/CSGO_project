Objective - CS:GO Round Winner Classification

About
The dataset consists of round snapshots from about 700 demos from high level tournament play in 2019 and 2020. Warmup rounds and restarts have been filtered, and for the remaining live rounds a round snapshot has been recorded every 20 seconds until the round is decided. Following its initial publication, It has been pre-processed and flattened to improve readability and make it easier for algorithms to process. The total number of snapshots is 122411. Snapshots are i.i.d and should be treated as individual data points, not as part of a match.
